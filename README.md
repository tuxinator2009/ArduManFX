#ArduManFX - A Library Manager for Arduboy's with the FX mod

### Features

- Local, cached, copy of Eried's Unofficial Arduboy Repo (https://arduboy.ried.cl/)
- Upload HEX files from the repository directly to a standard Arduboy
- Create flash cartridge images via a drag-and-drop interface from the list of available programs
- Read/Write flash cart images to modified/homebrew Arduboy's that have the RAM expansion mod (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
- Load/Save EEPROM to/from a file on your computer
- Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac
- Completely portable, no installation necessary. Repository is cached in the same folder as the executable.

This is still very much a work in progress and as of right now it only supports downloading the repository of programs and uploading them to the device.
